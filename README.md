##Recomendations for Louise
To conduct a successful kickstarter campaign for your play, I believe you should consider the following...

* Successful campaigns had an IQR of $3,500, with the upper quartile being $5,000 and the lower quartile being $1,500
* The pleged amount for the successful campaigns exceeded the goal by a few hundreds of dollars for each quartile statistic
* Most theater funding campaigns reached their highest amounts of support in May-July

Considering the information above, I would recommend you set your kickstarter goal no higher than $5,000 and announce in mid-April, so that it has time to gain traction prior to the ideal funding months.
